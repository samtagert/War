    <h3>THE DEAL</h3>
    <p>The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, face down.</p>
    <h3>THE PLAY</h3>
    <p>Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of their stack.</p>
    <h3>WAR</h3>
    <p>If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher card face up takes both piles (ten cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another three cards face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 18 cards, and so on.</p>
    <h3>HOW TO KEEP SCORE</h3>
    <p>The game ends when one player has won all the cards. If War happens and a player doesn't have the four cards needed to draw, they simply draw what they have, turning the last card face up.</p>
